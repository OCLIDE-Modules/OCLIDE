#Basic
G = A global variable (not a function) that holds the global environment (see \u00a72.2). Lua itself does not use this variable; changing its value does not affect any environment, nor vice versa.
VERSION = A global variable (not a function) that holds a string containing the running Lua version. The current value of this variable is "Lua 5.3".

assert = Calls error if the value of its argument v is false (i.e., nil or false); otherwise, returns all its arguments. In case of error, message is the error object; when absent, it defaults to "assertion failed!"
dofile = Opens the named file and executes its contents as a Lua chunk. When called without arguments, dofile executes the contents of the standard input (stdin). Returns all values returned by the chunk. In case of errors, dofile propagates the error to its caller (that is, dofile does not run in protected mode).
error = Terminates the last protected function called and returns message as the error object. Function error never returns. Usually, error adds some information about the error position at the beginning of the message, if the message is a string. The level argument specifies how to get the error position. With level 1 (the default), the error position is where the error function was called. Level 2 points the error to where the function that called error was called; and so on. Passing a level 0 avoids the addition of error position information to the message.
getmetatable = If object does not have a metatable, returns nil. Otherwise, if the object's metatable has a __metatable field, returns the associated value. Otherwise, returns the metatable of the given object.
ipairs = Returns three values (an iterator function, the table t, and 0).
load = Loads a chunk. If chunk is a string, the chunk is this string. If chunk is a function, load calls it repeatedly to get the chunk pieces. Each call to chunk must return a string that concatenates with previous results. A return of an empty string, nil, or no value signals the end of the chunk. If there are no syntactic errors, returns the compiled chunk as a function; otherwise, returns nil plus the error message. If the resulting function has upvalues, the first upvalue is set to the value of env, if that parameter is given, or to the value of the global environment. Other upvalues are initialized with nil. (When you load a main chunk, the resulting function will always have exactly one upvalue, the _ENV variable (see \u00a72.2). However, when you load a binary chunk created from a function (see string.dump), the resulting function can have an arbitrary number of upvalues.) All upvalues are fresh, that is, they are not shared with any other function. chunkname is used as the name of the chunk for error messages and debug information (see \u00a74.9). When absent, it defaults to chunk, if chunk is a string, or to "=(load)" otherwise. The string mode controls whether the chunk can be text or binary (that is, a precompiled chunk). It may be the string "b" (only binary chunks), "t" (only text chunks), or "bt" (both binary and text). The default is "bt". Lua does not check the consistency of binary chunks. Maliciously crafted binary chunks can crash the interpreter.
loadfile = Similar to load, but gets the chunk from file filename or from the standard input, if no file name is given.
next = Allows a program to traverse all fields of a table. Its first argument is a table and its second argument is an index in this table. next returns the next index of the table and its associated value. When called with nil as its second argument, next returns an initial index and its associated value. When called with the last index, or with nil in an empty table, next returns nil. If the second argument is absent, then it is interpreted as nil. In particular, you can use next(t) to check whether a table is empty. The order in which the indices are enumerated is not specified, even for numeric indices. (To traverse a table in numerical order, use a numerical for.) The behavior of next is undefined if, during the traversal, you assign any value to a non-existent field in the table. You may however modify existing fields. In particular, you may clear existing fields.
pairs = If t has a metamethod __pairs, calls it with t as argument and returns the first three results from the call. Otherwise, returns three values: the next function, the table t, and nil. See function next for the caveats of modifying the table during its traversal.
pcall = Calls function f with the given arguments in protected mode. This means that any error inside f is not propagated; instead, pcall catches the error and returns a status code. Its first result is the status code (a boolean), which is true if the call succeeds without errors. In such case, pcall also returns all results from the call, after this first result. In case of any error, pcall returns false plus the error message.
print = Receives any number of arguments and prints their values to stdout, using the tostring function to convert each argument to a string. print is not intended for formatted output, but only as a quick way to show a value, for instance for debugging. For complete control over the output, use string.format and io.write.
rawequal = Checks whether v1 is equal to v2, without invoking the __eq metamethod. Returns a boolean.
rawget = Gets the real value of table[index], without invoking the __index metamethod. table must be a table; index may be any value.
rawlen = Returns the length of the object v, which must be a table or a string, without invoking the __len metamethod. Returns an integer.
rawset = Sets the real value of table[index] to value, without invoking the __newindex metamethod. table must be a table, index any value different from nil and NaN, and value any Lua value. This function returns table.
select = If index is a number, returns all arguments after argument number index; a negative number indexes from the end (-1 is the last argument). Otherwise, index must be the string "#", and select returns the total number of extra arguments it received.
setmetatable = Sets the metatable for the given table. (To change the metatable of other types from Lua code, you must use the debug library (\u00a76.10).) If metatable is nil, removes the metatable of the given table. If the original metatable has a __metatable field, raises an error. This function returns table.
tonumber = When called with no base, tonumber tries to convert its argument to a number. If the argument is already a number or a string convertible to a number, then tonumber returns this number; otherwise, it returns nil. The conversion of strings can result in integers or floats, according to the lexical conventions of Lua (see \u00a73.1). (The string may have leading and trailing spaces and a sign.) When called with base, then e must be a string to be interpreted as an integer numeral in that base. The base may be any integer between 2 and 36, inclusive. In bases above 10, the letter 'A' (in either upper or lower case) represents 10, 'B' represents 11, and so forth, with 'Z' representing 35. If the string e is not a valid numeral in the given base, the function returns nil.
tostring = Receives a value of any type and converts it to a string in a human-readable format. (For complete control of how numbers are converted, use string.format.) If the metatable of v has a __tostring field, then tostring calls the corresponding value with v as argument, and uses the result of the call as its result.
type = Returns the type of its only argument, coded as a string. The possible results of this function are "nil" (a string, not the value nil), "number", "string", "boolean", "table", "function", "thread", and "userdata".
xpcall = This function is similar to pcall, except that it sets a new message handler msgh.

#Coroutine
coroutine_create = Creates a new coroutine, with body f. f must be a function. Returns this new coroutine, an object with type "thread".
coroutine_isyieldable = Returns true when the running coroutine can yield. A running coroutine is yieldable if it is not the main thread and it is not inside a non-yieldable C function.
coroutine_resume = Starts or continues the execution of coroutine co. The first time you resume a coroutine, it starts running its body. The values val1, ... are passed as the arguments to the body function. If the coroutine has yielded, resume restarts it; the values val1, ... are passed as the results from the yield. If the coroutine runs without any errors, resume returns true plus any values passed to yield (when the coroutine yields) or any values returned by the body function (when the coroutine terminates). If there is any error, resume returns false plus the error message.
coroutine_running = Returns the running coroutine plus a boolean, true when the running coroutine is the main one.
coroutine_status = Returns the status of coroutine co, as a string: "running", if the coroutine is running (that is, it called status); "suspended", if the coroutine is suspended in a call to yield, or if it has not started running yet; "normal" if the coroutine is active but not running (that is, it has resumed another coroutine); and "dead" if the coroutine has finished its body function, or if it has stopped with an error.
coroutine_wrap = Creates a new coroutine, with body f. f must be a function. Returns a function that resumes the coroutine each time it is called. Any arguments passed to the function behave as the extra arguments to resume. Returns the same values returned by resume, except the first boolean. In case of error, propagates the error.
coroutine_yield = Suspends the execution of the calling coroutine. Any arguments to yield are passed as extra results to resume.

#Debug
debug_getinfo = Returns a table with information about a function. You can give the function directly or you can give a number as the value of f, which means the function running at level f of the call stack of the given thread: level 0 is the current function (getinfo itself); level 1 is the function that called getinfo (except for tail calls, which do not count on the stack); and so on. If f is a number larger than the number of active functions, then getinfo returns nil. The returned table can contain all the fields returned by lua_getinfo, with the string what describing which fields to fill in. The default for what is to get all information available, except the table of valid lines. If present, the option 'f' adds a field named func with the function itself. If present, the option 'L' adds a field named activelines with the table of valid lines. For instance, the expression debug.getinfo(1,"n").name returns a name for the current function, if a reasonable name can be found, and the expression debug.getinfo(print) returns a table with all available information about the print function.
debug_traceback = If message is present but is neither a string nor nil, this function returns message without further processing. Otherwise, it returns a string with a traceback of the call stack. The optional message string is appended at the beginning of the traceback. An optional level number tells at which level to start the traceback (default is 1, the function calling traceback).

#IO
io_close = Equivalent to file:close(). Without a file, closes the default output file.
io_flush = Equivalent to io.output():flush().
io_input = When called with a file name, it opens the named file (in text mode), and sets its handle as the default input file. When called with a file handle, it simply sets this file handle as the default input file. When called without arguments, it returns the current default input file. In case of errors this function raises the error, instead of returning an error code.
io_lines = Opens the given file name in read mode and returns an iterator function that works like file:lines(\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7) over the opened file. When the iterator function detects the end of file, it returns no values (to finish the loop) and automatically closes the file. The call io.lines() (with no file name) is equivalent to io.input():lines("*l"); that is, it iterates over the lines of the default input file. In this case, the iterator does not close the file when the loop ends. In case of errors this function raises the error, instead of returning an error code.
io_open = This function opens a file, in the mode specified in the string mode. In case of success, it returns a new file handle. The mode string can be any of the following: "r": read mode (the default); "w": write mode; "a": append mode; "r+": update mode, all previous data is preserved; "w+": update mode, all previous data is erased; "a+": append update mode, previous data is preserved, writing is only allowed at the end of file. The mode string can also have a 'b' at the end, which is needed in some systems to open the file in binary mode.
io_output = Similar to io.input, but operates over the default output file.
io_popen = This function is system dependent and is not available on all platforms. Starts program prog in a separated process and returns a file handle that you can use to read data from this program (if mode is "r", the default) or to write data to this program (if mode is "w").
io_read = Equivalent to io.input():read(\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7).
io_tmpfile = In case of success, returns a handle for a temporary file. This file is opened in update mode and it is automatically removed when the program ends.
io_type = Checks whether obj is a valid file handle. Returns the string "file" if obj is an open file handle, "closed file" if obj is a closed file handle, or nil if obj is not a file handle.
io_write = Equivalent to io.output():write(\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7).

#Math
math_abs = Returns the absolute value of x. (integer/float)
math_acos = Returns the arc cosine of x (in radians).
math_asin = Returns the arc sine of x (in radians).
math_atan = Returns the arc tangent of y/x (in radians), but uses the signs of both arguments to find the quadrant of the result. (It also handles correctly the case of x being zero.) The default value for x is 1, so that the call math.atan(y) returns the arc tangent of y.
math_ceil = Returns the smallest integral value larger than or equal to x.
math_cos = Returns the cosine of x (assumed to be in radians).
math_deg = Converts the angle x from radians to degrees.
math_exp = Returns the value ex (where e is the base of natural logarithms).
math_floor = Returns the largest integral value smaller than or equal to x.
math_fmod = Returns the remainder of the division of x by y that rounds the quotient towards zero. (integer/float)
math_huge = The float value HUGE_VAL, a value larger than any other numeric value.
math_log = Returns the logarithm of x in the given base. The default for base is e (so that the function returns the natural logarithm of x).
math_max = Returns the argument with the maximum value, according to the Lua operator <. (integer/float)
math_maxinteger = An integer with the maximum value for an integer.
math_min = Returns the argument with the minimum value, according to the Lua operator <. (integer/float)
math_mininteger = An integer with the minimum value for an integer.
math_modf = Returns the integral part of x and the fractional part of x. Its second result is always a float.
math_pi = The value of \u03c0.
math_rad = Converts the angle x from degrees to radians.
math_random = When called without arguments, returns a pseudo-random float with uniform distribution in the range [0,1). When called with two integers m and n, math.random returns a pseudo-random integer with uniform distribution in the range [m, n]. (The value n-m cannot be negative and must fit in a Lua integer.) The call math.random(n) is equivalent to math.random(1,n). This function is an interface to the underling pseudo-random generator function provided by C.
math_randomseed = Sets x as the "seed" for the pseudo-random generator: equal seeds produce equal sequences of numbers.
math_sin = Returns the sine of x (assumed to be in radians).
math_sqrt = Returns the square root of x. (You can also use the expression x^0.5 to compute this value.)
math_tan = Returns the tangent of x (assumed to be in radians).
math_tointeger = If the value x is convertible to an integer, returns that integer. Otherwise, returns nil.
math_type = Returns "integer" if x is an integer, "float" if it is a float, or nil if x is not a number.
math_ult = Returns a boolean, true if and only if integer m is below integer n when they are compared as unsigned integers.

#OS
os_clock = Returns an approximation of the amount in seconds of CPU time used by the program.
os_date = Returns a string or a table containing date and time, formatted according to the given string format. If the time argument is present, this is the time to be formatted (see the os.time function for a description of this value). Otherwise, date formats the current time. If format starts with '!', then the date is formatted in Coordinated Universal Time. After this optional character, if format is the string "*t", then date returns a table with the following fields: year, month (1\u201312), day (1\u201331), hour (0\u201323), min (0\u201359), sec (0\u201361), wday (weekday, 1\u20137, Sunday is 1), yday (day of the year, 1\u2013366), and isdst (daylight saving flag, a boolean). This last field may be absent if the information is not available. If format is not "*t", then date returns the date as a string, formatted according to the same rules as the ISO C function strftime. When called without arguments, date returns a reasonable date and time representation that depends on the host system and on the current locale. (More specifically, os.date() is equivalent to os.date("%c").) In non-POSIX systems, this function may be not thread safe because of its reliance on C function gmtime and C function localtime.
os_difftime = Returns the difference, in seconds, from time t1 to time t2 (where the times are values returned by os.time). In POSIX, Windows, and some other systems, this value is exactly t2-t1.
os_execute = This function is equivalent to the ISO C function system. It passes command to be executed by an operating system shell. Its first result is true if the command terminated successfully, or nil otherwise. After this first result the function returns a string plus a number, as follows: "exit": the command terminated normally; the following number is the exit status of the command. "signal": the command was terminated by a signal; the following number is the signal that terminated the command. When called without a command, os.execute returns a boolean that is true if a shell is available.
os_exit = Calls the ISO C function exit to terminate the host program. If code is true, the returned status is EXIT_SUCCESS; if code is false, the returned status is EXIT_FAILURE; if code is a number, the returned status is this number. The default value for code is true. If the optional second argument close is true, closes the Lua state before exiting.
os_getenv = Returns the value of the process environment variable varname, or nil if the variable is not defined.
os_remove = Deletes the file (or empty directory, on POSIX systems) with the given name. If this function fails, it returns nil, plus a string describing the error and the error code. Otherwise, it returns true.
os_rename = Renames the file or directory named oldname to newname. If this function fails, it returns nil, plus a string describing the error and the error code. Otherwise, it returns true.
os_time = Returns the current time when called without arguments, or a time representing the local date and time specified by the given table. This table must have fields year, month, and day, and may have fields hour (default is 12), min (default is 0), sec (default is 0), and isdst (default is nil). Other fields are ignored. For a description of these fields, see the os.date function. The values in these fields do not need to be inside their valid ranges. For instance, if sec is -10, it means -10 seconds from the time specified by the other fields; if hour is 1000, it means +1000 hours from the time specified by the other fields. The returned value is a number, whose meaning depends on your system. In POSIX, Windows, and some other systems, this number counts the number of seconds since some given start time (the "epoch"). In other systems, the meaning is not specified, and the number returned by time can be used only as an argument to os.date and os.difftime.
os_tmpname = Returns a string with a file name that can be used for a temporary file. The file must be explicitly opened before its use and explicitly removed when no longer needed. In POSIX systems, this function also creates a file with that name, to avoid security risks. (Someone else might create the file with wrong permissions in the time between getting the name and creating the file.) You still have to open the file to use it and to remove it (even if you do not use it). When possible, you may prefer to use io.tmpfile, which automatically removes the file when the program ends.

#Package
require = Loads the given module. The function starts by looking into the package.loaded table to determine whether modname is already loaded. If it is, then require returns the value stored at package.loaded[modname]. Otherwise, it tries to find a loader for the module. To find a loader, require is guided by the package.searchers sequence. By changing this sequence, we can change how require looks for a module. The following explanation is based on the default configuration for package.searchers. First require queries package.preload[modname]. If it has a value, this value (which must be a function) is the loader. Otherwise require searches for a Lua loader using the path stored in package.path. If that also fails, it searches for a C loader using the path stored in package.cpath. If that also fails, it tries an all-in-one loader (see package.searchers). Once a loader is found, require calls the loader with two arguments: modname and an extra value dependent on how it got the loader. (If the loader came from a file, this extra value is the file name.) If the loader returns any non-nil value, require assigns the returned value to package.loaded[modname]. If the loader does not return a non-nil value and has not assigned any value to package.loaded[modname], then require assigns true to this entry. In any case, require returns the final value of package.loaded[modname]. If there is any error loading or running the module, or if it cannot find any loader for the module, then require raises an error.
package_loaded = A table used by require to control which modules are already loaded. When you require a module modname and package.loaded[modname] is not false, require simply returns the value stored there. This variable is only a reference to the real table; assignments to this variable do not change the table used by require.
package_path = The path used by require to search for a Lua loader. At start-up, Lua initializes this variable with the value of the environment variable LUA_PATH_5_3 or the environment variable LUA_PATH or with a default path defined in luaconf.h, if those environment variables are not defined. Any ";;" in the value of the environment variable is replaced by the default path.
package_preload = A table to store loaders for specific modules (see require). This variable is only a reference to the real table; assignments to this variable do not change the table used by require.
package_searchers = A table used by require to control how to load modules. Each entry in this table is a searcher function. When looking for a module, require calls each of these searchers in ascending order, with the module name (the argument given to require) as its sole parameter. The function can return another function (the module loader) plus an extra value that will be passed to that loader, or a string explaining why it did not find that module (or nil if it has nothing to say). Lua initializes this table with four searcher functions. The first searcher simply looks for a loader in the package.preload table. The second searcher looks for a loader as a Lua library, using the path stored at package.path. The search is done as described in function package.searchpath. The third searcher looks for a loader as a C library, using the path given by the variable package.cpath. Again, the search is done as described in function package.searchpath. For instance, if the C path is the string "./?.so;./?.dll;/usr/local/?/init.so" the searcher for module foo will try to open the files ./foo.so, ./foo.dll, and /usr/local/foo/init.so, in that order. Once it finds a C library, this searcher first uses a dynamic link facility to link the application with the library. Then it tries to find a C function inside the library to be used as the loader. The name of this C function is the string "luaopen_" concatenated with a copy of the module name where each dot is replaced by an underscore. Moreover, if the module name has a hyphen, its suffix after (and including) the first hyphen is removed. For instance, if the module name is a.b.c-v2.1, the function name will be luaopen_a_b_c. The fourth searcher tries an all-in-one loader. It searches the C path for a library for the root name of the given module. For instance, when requiring a.b.c, it will search for a C library for a. If found, it looks into it for an open function for the submodule; in our example, that would be luaopen_a_b_c. With this facility, a package can pack several C submodules into one single library, with each submodule keeping its original open function. All searchers except the first one (preload) return as the extra value the file name where the module was found, as returned by package.searchpath. The first searcher returns no extra value.
package_searchpath = Searches for the given name in the given path. A path is a string containing a sequence of templates separated by semicolons. For each template, the function replaces each interrogation mark (if any) in the template with a copy of name wherein all occurrences of sep (a dot, by default) were replaced by rep (the system's directory separator, by default), and then tries to open the resulting file name. For instance, if the path is the string "./?.lua;./?.lc;/usr/local/?/init.lua" the search for the name foo.a will try to open the files ./foo/a.lua, ./foo/a.lc, and /usr/local/foo/a/init.lua, in that order. Returns the resulting name of the first file that it can open in read mode (after closing the file), or nil plus an error message if none succeeds. (This error message lists all file names it tried to open.)

#String
string_byte = Returns the internal numeric codes of the characters s[i], s[i+1], ..., s[j]. The default value for i is 1; the default value for j is i. These indices are corrected following the same rules of function string.sub. Numeric codes are not necessarily portable across platforms.
string_char = Receives zero or more integers. Returns a string with length equal to the number of arguments, in which each character has the internal numeric code equal to its corresponding argument. Numeric codes are not necessarily portable across platforms.
string_dump = Returns a string containing a binary representation (a binary chunk) of the given function, so that a later load on this string returns a copy of the function (but with new upvalues). If strip is a true value, the binary representation may not include all debug information about the function, to save space. Functions with upvalues have only their number of upvalues saved. When (re)loaded, those upvalues receive fresh instances containing nil. (You can use the debug library to serialize and reload the upvalues of a function in a way adequate to your needs.)
string_find = Looks for the first match of pattern (see \u00a76.4.1) in the string s. If it finds a match, then find returns the indices of s where this occurrence starts and ends; otherwise, it returns nil. A third, optional numeric argument init specifies where to start the search; its default value is 1 and can be negative. A value of true as a fourth, optional argument plain turns off the pattern matching facilities, so the function does a plain "find substring" operation, with no characters in pattern being considered magic. Note that if plain is given, then init must be given as well. If the pattern has captures, then in a successful match the captured values are also returned, after the two indices.
string_format = Returns a formatted version of its variable number of arguments following the description given in its first argument (which must be a string). The format string follows the same rules as the ISO C function sprintf. The only differences are that the options/modifiers *, h, L, l, n, and p are not supported and that there is an extra option, q. The q option formats a string between double quotes, using escape sequences when necessary to ensure that it can safely be read back by the Lua interpreter. Options A, a, E, e, f, G, and g all expect a number as argument. Options c, d, i, o, u, X, and x expect an integer. When Lua is compiled with a C89 compiler, options A and a (hexadecimal floats) do not support any modifier (flags, width, length). Option s expects a string; if its argument is not a string, it is converted to one following the same rules of tostring. If the option has any modifier (flags, width, length), the string argument should not contain embedded zeros.
string_gmatch = Returns an iterator function that, each time it is called, returns the next captures from pattern (see \u00a76.4.1) over the string s. If pattern specifies no captures, then the whole match is produced in each call. For this function, a caret '^' at the start of a pattern does not work as an anchor, as this would prevent the iteration.
string_gsub = Returns a copy of s in which all (or the first n, if given) occurrences of the pattern (see \u00a76.4.1) have been replaced by a replacement string specified by repl, which can be a string, a table, or a function. gsub also returns, as its second value, the total number of matches that occurred. The name gsub comes from Global SUBstitution. If repl is a string, then its value is used for replacement. The character % works as an escape character: any sequence in repl of the form %d, with d between 1 and 9, stands for the value of the d-th captured substring. The sequence %0 stands for the whole match. The sequence %% stands for a single %. If repl is a table, then the table is queried for every match, using the first capture as the key. If repl is a function, then this function is called every time a match occurs, with all captured substrings passed as arguments, in order. In any case, if the pattern specifies no captures, then it behaves as if the whole pattern was inside a capture. If the value returned by the table query or by the function call is a string or a number, then it is used as the replacement string; otherwise, if it is false or nil, then there is no replacement (that is, the original match is kept in the string).
string_len = Receives a string and returns its length. The empty string "" has length 0. Embedded zeros are counted, so "a\000bc\000" has length 5.
string_lower = Receives a string and returns a copy of this string with all uppercase letters changed to lowercase. All other characters are left unchanged. The definition of what an uppercase letter is depends on the current locale.
string_match = Looks for the first match of pattern (see \u00a76.4.1) in the string s. If it finds one, then match returns the captures from the pattern; otherwise it returns nil. If pattern specifies no captures, then the whole match is returned. A third, optional numeric argument init specifies where to start the search; its default value is 1 and can be negative.
string_pack = Returns a binary string containing the values v1, v2, etc. packed (that is, serialized in binary form) according to the format string fmt (see \u00a76.4.2).
string_packsize = Returns the size of a string resulting from string.pack with the given format. The format string cannot have the variable-length options 's' or 'z' (see \u00a76.4.2).
string_rep = Returns a string that is the concatenation of n copies of the string s separated by the string sep. The default value for sep is the empty string (that is, no separator). Returns the empty string if n is not positive. (Note that it is very easy to exhaust the memory of your machine with a single call to this function.)
string_reverse = Returns a string that is the string s reversed.
string_sub = Returns the substring of s that starts at i and continues until j; i and j can be negative. If j is absent, then it is assumed to be equal to -1 (which is the same as the string length). In particular, the call string.sub(s,1,j) returns a prefix of s with length j, and string.sub(s, -i) (for a positive i) returns a suffix of s with length i. If, after the translation of negative indices, i is less than 1, it is corrected to 1. If j is greater than the string length, it is corrected to that length. If, after these corrections, i is greater than j, the function returns the empty string.
string_unpack = Returns the values packed in string s (see string.pack) according to the format string fmt (see \u00a76.4.2). An optional pos marks where to start reading in s (default is 1). After the read values, this function also returns the index of the first unread byte in s.
string_upper = Receives a string and returns a copy of this string with all lowercase letters changed to uppercase. All other characters are left unchanged. The definition of what a lowercase letter is depends on the current locale.

#Table
table_concat = Given a list where all elements are strings or numbers, returns the string list[i]..sep..list[i+1] \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 sep..list[j]. The default value for sep is the empty string, the default for i is 1, and the default for j is #list. If i is greater than j, returns the empty string.
table_insert = Inserts element value at position pos in list, shifting up the elements list[pos], list[pos+1], \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, list[#list]. The default value for pos is #list+1, so that a call table.insert(t,x) inserts x at the end of list t.
table_move = Moves elements from table a1 to table a2, performing the equivalent to the following multiple assignment: a2[t],\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 = a1[f],\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7,a1[e]. The default for a2 is a1. The destination range can overlap with the source range. The number of elements to be moved must fit in a Lua integer. Returns the destination table a2.
table_pack = Returns a new table with all arguments stored into keys 1, 2, etc. and with a field "n" with the total number of arguments. Note that the resulting table may not be a sequence.
table_remove = Removes from list the element at position pos, returning the value of the removed element. When pos is an integer between 1 and #list, it shifts down the elements list[pos+1], list[pos+2], \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, list[#list] and erases element list[#list]; The index pos can also be 0 when #list is 0, or #list + 1; in those cases, the function erases the element list[pos]. The default value for pos is #list, so that a call table.remove(l) removes the last element of list l.
table_sort = Sorts list elements in a given order, in-place, from list[1] to list[#list]. If comp is given, then it must be a function that receives two list elements and returns true when the first element must come before the second in the final order (so that, after the sort, i < j implies not comp(list[j],list[i])). If comp is not given, then the standard Lua operator < is used instead. Note that the comp function must define a strict partial order over the elements in the list; that is, it must be asymmetric and transitive. Otherwise, no valid sort may be possible. The sort algorithm is not stable: elements considered equal by the given order may have their relative positions changed by the sort.
table_unpack = Returns the elements from the given list. By default, i is 1 and j is #list.
